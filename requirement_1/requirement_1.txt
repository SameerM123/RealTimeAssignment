On hilly terrain, an adaptive cruise control system faces a major challenge — the radar or lidar may lose sight of the lead vehicle when going over a crest, causing the system to misinterpret the environment and accelerate unexpectedly. 
To address this, the proposed design integrates predictive sensing and real-time decision control. The system fuses GPS and digital elevation data with radar and camera inputs to anticipate slope changes ahead. 
When a steep incline or decline is detected, it activates a “Hill Mode,” where the controller preemptively adjusts throttle and braking to maintain a safe following distance even if the target vehicle becomes temporarily obscured. 
If sensor confidence drops below a set threshold, the system maintains the current speed instead of accelerating, preventing unsafe behavior. 
All core control loops operate within 100 milliseconds to meet real-time responsiveness, while lower-priority tasks—such as hill detection and data fusion—run asynchronously and communicate via event flags and shared buffers. 
This ensures timing predictability and stable operation under varying road conditions. The approach prioritizes safety, reliability, and smooth driver experience, even in challenging hill environments.
